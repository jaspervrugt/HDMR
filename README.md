# MATLAB Toolboxes of High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) with Uncorrelated and/or Correlated Input Variables

## Description

We provide two MATLAB toolboxes, 'MATLAB_code_HDMR_V1.0' and 'MATLAB_code_HDMR_EXT_V1.0', for global sensitivity analysis (GSA) with uncorrelated and/or correlated input variables. Examples are included in both toolboxes. 

For a brief overview of these two toolboxes, 'MATLAB_code_HDMR_V1.0' is based on the HDMR method of Li et al. (2010) while 'MATLAB_code_HDMR_EXT_V1.0'  is based on the  HDMRext method of Li and Rabitz (2012).

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Download and unzip the zip file 'sensitivity-main.zip'.
* Add either toolbox to your MATLAB search path by running 'install_HDMR.m' available in 'MATLAB_code_HDMR_V1.0' or 'install_HDMR_EXT.m' available in 'MATLAB_code_HDMR_EXT_V1.0'.
* You are ready to run the examples.

### Executing program

* After intalling, you can simply direct to each example folder and execute the 'example_X.m' file.
* Please Make sure you read carefully the instructions (i.e., green comments) in 'install_HDMR.m' and 'install_HDMR_EXT.m' !!!  Following similar steps as presented in the examples, you can also conduct GSA of your own models.
* If you are running example_4 in 'MATLAB_code_HDMR_EXT_V1.0', please first download the folder 'MATLAB_code_HDMR_EXT_V1.0/example_4/samples' from our [Zenodo repository] (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7478901) and copypaste the folder 'samples' to 'yourdirectory/MATLAB_code_HDMR_EXT_V1.0/example_4'.

## Acknowledgments
The MATLAB toolboxes are based on the published works of Genyuan Li from Princeton University. We greatly appreciate him answering our questions. This has helped us finalize the MATLAB codes of HDMR and HDMR_EXT.
